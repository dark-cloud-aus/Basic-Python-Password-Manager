# DigiCore Password Manager Script V1.4, written by David Gilmore.  This is a simple script to allow DigiCore staff
# to save their stored password. Script created on 10th May 2023.

# The first part of the script here is for the main menu. Ive used the define function so i can come back to the menu each time

# Now we have our choices. Depending on what option is chosen the a function is created and the user is sent to that part of the code block.

#Using the else command here covers the user inputting anything other then 1,2 or 3 and asks them to try again and returning to the main menu after
    else:

# In this section of the code we handle the creation of the text file using the Append command which makes sure if there is not already a file
# one is created for us
